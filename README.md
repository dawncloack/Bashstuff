# Bashstuff
A collection of bash scripts that I have developed for personal use, then put in the public domain.

EPOPatentCounter.sh is a script that takes any number of csv files of the type provided by the European Patent Office and creates a csv document that 
contains two columns: Year and Patents in the files filed that year.

EPOParser.sh is a much more complete version of EPOPatentCounter.sh. It parses all of the fields that are not unique codes. It will produce a .csv file with the number of hits of each field.
