# Bashstuff
A collection of bash scripts that I have developed for personal use, then put in the public domain.

EPOPatentCounter.sh is a script that takes any number of csv files of the type provided by the European Patent Office and creates a csv document that 
contains two columns: Year and Patents in the files filed that year.
